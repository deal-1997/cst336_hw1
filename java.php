            <ol>Java is a class-based, object-oriented 
            programming language that is designed to 
            have as few implementation dependencies as 
            possible. It is a general-purpose programming 
            language intended to let application developers 
            write once, run anywhere WORA,meaning 
            that compiled Java code can run on all 
            platforms that support Java without the need 
            for recompilation.[18] Java applications are 
            typically compiled to bytecode that can run on 
            any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of 
            the underlying computer architecture. 
            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
            but has fewer low-level facilities than either 
            of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic 
            capabilities (such as reflection and runtime 
            code modification) that are typically not 
            available in traditional compiled languages.</p>
